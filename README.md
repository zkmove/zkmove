## zkMove

**zkMove:** A Zero-Knowledge Move Language Virtual Machine that verifies the execution of arbitrary Move smart contracts. A typical application scenario is off-chain computing. It can empower Move smart contracts to access private data and external resources in a trust-free manner.

- Security: Fully compatible with Move. Supports all Move instructions and value types. Supports runtime safety checks, and has the same level of security as MoveVM. Supports commonly used development tools in the Move ecosystem.
- Efficiency: With state-of-the-art circuit design and the most advanced memory consistency checking algorithms. Supports complex data types and safety checks while ensuring optimal performance.
- Client-Side Proving: Any information we wish to keep confidential should be fully processed on the user's device, without exposure to any third party. zkMove adheres to this design philosophy, requiring computations with privacy requirements to be proven on the client side.

**Snark verifier:** A generic halo2 snark verifier written in Move. It enables any zk proof generated by halo2 to be verified on Move blockchains.
