## zkMove

**zkMove:** A Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine that proves the execution of any Move smart contracts.

- Fully compatible with Move and inherits Move's security.
- State-of-the-art circuit design and cutting-edge performance.
- Client-side proving to naturally preserve user privacy.
- Compatible with commonly used development tools in the ecosystem.
- Allows existing Move programs to run without modifications.

Typical application scenarios include cross-chain interoperability, scale computation-intensive applications, privacy-preserving dApps, and so on.

**Snark verifier:** A generic halo2 snark verifier written in Move. It enables any zk proof generated by halo2 to be verified on Move blockchains.
